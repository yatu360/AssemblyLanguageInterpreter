+ Good submission
+ You have restructured the code which meant that our tests failed.
+ It was a requirement of the specification that one did not change the codebase other than indicated.
+ While the changes you have made are good (by and large) they contravene the specification.
+ In a standalone situation that would be fine but this is part of an existing codebase and you should not do that.
+ Try and utilise lambda expressions and streams rather than procedural `for` loops where possible. 
+ Testing is fine.
+ Perhaps add some additional comments and javadoc where necessary.
+ Excellent use of reflection API.
